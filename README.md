[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg)](https://github.com/dduk-ddak/coding-night-live/blob/master/LICENSE)

**Coding-Night-Live** is a Web-Based Communication Application for codelabs.
> Codelab is a fun step-by-step, seminar-based approach to developing a software together. 

Popular web-based applications like `Slack`, `PingPong`, etc., do exist for hosting interactive seminars, but none are customized exclusively for the codelabs. Coding-Night-Live is the light-weight, installation-free, web-based solution for the awesome codelab-thristy programmers!
